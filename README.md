## 🐍 **15-Day Python Language Mastery Challenge**

### 🎯 **Challenge Overview & Commitment**

Welcome to my accelerated learning repository! This project documents my commitment to achieving foundational mastery of the Python programming language in just **15 consecutive days**. This challenge is structured to cover core syntax, fundamental data structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles through an intensive, hands-on approach.

| Metric | Target | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Duration** | 15 Days | ⏳ In Progress |
| **Language Focus** | Python 3 | ✅ Confirmed |
| **Goal** | Foundational Proficiency (Syntax, DSA Basics, Functions) | 🚀 High Priority |

### 💡 **My Learning Methodology (How to Learn)**

My 15-day strategy is divided into three focused phases:

#### Phase 1: Foundations (Day 1 - 5)
* **Focus:** Core Syntax, Data Types (Int, Float, Boolean), Variables, Operators, and Control Flow (If/Else, Loops).
* **Practice Goal:** Completing all basic exercises on W3Schools and solving simple arithmetic problems.

#### Phase 2: Data Structures & Functions (Day 6 - 10)
* **Focus:** Understanding and implementing Python's primary built-in data structures:
    * **List** (Arrays)
    * **Tuple**
    * **Dictionary** (Hash Maps)
    * **Set**
* **Practice Goal:** Writing and using custom functions, parameter passing, return values, and list comprehension.

#### Phase 3: OOP & Practical Application (Day 11 - 15)
* **Focus:** Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance), File Handling (I/O), and Introduction to basic Modules (e.g., `random`, `math`).
* **Practice Goal:** Building small, practical command-line applications (e.g., a simple calculator or file reader) to solidify learning.

### 📚 **Resources Followed**

I am utilizing a blend of high-quality video tutorials, official documentation, and interactive coding platforms to maximize learning efficiency.

| Resource Type | Source Name | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Video Course** | **Apna College (Hindi)** | In-depth concept explanation, intuitive examples, and problem-solving approach. |
| **Interactive Platform** | **W3Schools** | Quick syntax referencing, interactive examples, and solving basic self-paced tutorials. |
| **Official Documentation** | **Python Main Sites (python.org)** | Standardized definitions, PEP guidelines, and authoritative information on best practices. |
| **Code Practice** | **(Self-Added)** | Implementing small code snippets and testing concepts immediately. |

### 📈 **Commitment & Future Plans**

Upon successful completion of this 15-day challenge, I plan to:

1.  Transition to solving intermediate-level DSA problems on platforms like LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks.
2.  Begin exploring Python libraries essential for my specific domain (e.g., Data Science, Web Development, or Automation).

This repository will serve as the core record of all code snippets, practice files, and final projects completed during this challenge period.
